Housing Price Analysis (Excel-Based)

This project analyzes factors that influence housing prices using Microsoft Excel. Statistical techniques such as 
descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple regression were applied.

📂 Dataset Overview

Source: Kaggle Housing Dataset

Rows: 546

Columns: 13

Target Variable: Price

Key Variables

Numerical: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Stories, Parking

Categorical (Yes/No):
MainRoad, GuestRoom, Basement, Hot Water Heating,
AirConditioning, Preferred Area, Furnishing Status

🧹 Data Preparation in Excel
Convert Yes/No to Binary (1/0)

Excel formula used:

=IF(A2="Yes",1,0)


This conversion allows categorical variables to be used in:

Correlation analysis

Regression modeling

📈 Descriptive Statistics

Excel functions used:

=AVERAGE(range)
=MIN(range)
=MAX(range)
=STDEV.P(range)

Summary Highlights

Average house price ≈ 4.77 million

Average land size ≈ 5,151 sq ft

Most houses have 3 bedrooms, 1–2 bathrooms, and 2 stories

🔗 Correlation Analysis

Excel formula:

=CORREL(price_range, variable_range)

Binary Variables vs Price
Variable	Correlation
Air Conditioning	0.453
Preferred Area	0.330
Main Road	0.297
Guest Room	0.256
Basement	0.187
Hot Water Heating	0.093

Insight: Comfort and location-related features show stronger relationships with house price.

Numerical Variables vs Price
Variable	Correlation
Area (sq ft)	0.536
Bathrooms	0.518
Stories	0.421
Parking	0.384
Bedrooms	0.366

Insight: Property size and number of bathrooms influence price more than bedroom count.

📉 Multiple Regression Analysis

Regression was performed using:

Data → Data Analysis → Regression

Model Statistics

R²: 0.682

Adjusted R²: 0.674

F-statistic: 87.52

Significance F: 9.07E-123

✅ The model explains 68% of the variation in housing prices.

Significant Predictors (p < 0.05)
Variable	Impact on Price
Area (sq ft)	+244 per sq ft
Bathrooms	+987,668
Air Conditioning	+864,958
Hot Water Heating	+855,447
Preferred Area	+651,544
Stories	+450,848
Fully Furnished	+411,234
Parking	+277,107
Not Significant

Bedrooms (p = 0.114)
→ Not a strong predictor when other variables are considered.
 Likely due to area of rooms and living spaces not given in the dataset
🧠 Key Findings

House prices are driven mainly by land size, bathrooms, location, and amenities

Binary variables, when properly encoded, add meaningful insights

Excel is sufficient for robust housing price analysis

🛠 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Correlation, Regression)
