# House Price Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes factors that influence housing prices using a real-world housing dataset.  
The objective is to identify key property features that significantly affect house prices and to present insights through clear analysis and dashboards.

---

## Dataset Description
- Source: Kaggle Housing Dataset  
- Records: 546 houses  
- Variables: 13 features including price, land area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and amenities  

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical variables describing housing characteristics across different neighborhoods.

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis  
- Power BI –  dashboards and visualizations  

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**
   - Imported CSV data into Excel
   - Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
   - Converted Yes/No variables into binary (1/0) format

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created price per square foot
   - Categorized land size into Small, Medium, and Large
   - Generated helper columns for analysis and visualization

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visual comparison of house price against key variables

4. **Modeling (Optional)**
   - Linear and multiple regression analysis to assess the impact of housing features on price

## Key Insights
- Land area shows a positive relationship with house price  
- Houses with more bedrooms and bathrooms generally command higher prices  
- Amenities such as air conditioning and preferred location significantly increase house value  
- Furnishing status impacts price, with fully furnished houses priced higher on average  

---

## Visualizations
- Average house price by number of bedrooms  
- Average house price by number of bathrooms  
- Price comparison by furnishing status  
- Interactive Power BI dashboard with for user exploration  

---

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms that both physical attributes and amenities play an important role in determining housing prices.  
This project demonstrates the use of Excel and Power BI to transform raw housing data into actionable insights.

---

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional datasets, incluse physical size of rooms and living spaces, compare land price in choice neighbourhood
-  such as location or economic indicators  
- Apply advanced regression or machine learning models  
- Enhance dashboard interactivity and design
